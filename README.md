# Indigo Slate Alaska App Code Sample

In this sample, I have built out an app that uses CSS3 animations, some light JQuery and html.  To run it, you need to install NodeJS, available here [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

I chose to supply this sample with a backend to demonstrate how to get dynamic data from a server or remote source and incorporate it in the UI.

To run the sample:

1.  Install Node
2.  Open a command prompt
3.  Navigate to the cloned Git repo on your local machine
4.  Type *npm install* to install Node dependencies (express)
5.  Once the dependencies have been installed, type *node server.js* to start the express server
6.  In a browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
7.  Click through the sample
