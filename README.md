# Indigo Slate Alaska App Code Sample

In this sample, I have built out an app that uses CSS3 animations, some light JQuery and html.  To run it, you need to install NodeJS, available here [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

* Install Node
* Open a command prompt
* Navigate to the cloned Git repo on your local machine
* Type *npm install* to install Node dependencies (express)
* Once the dependencies have been installed, type *node server.js* to start the express server
* In a browser, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Click through the sample
